# Shortest-Path-using-BFS
I did a visualisation of BFS for finding the shortest path between 2 locations

# How to run it:
- you need to have pygame, if you dont have it type pip install pygame
- type python BFS.py and play with it

# How to use it:
- stage 1: draw the obstacles just by holding left click and moving the mouse around
  - when you're done press space for the next stage
- stage 2: click a cell for the starting point, then click another cell for the ending point
  - when you're done press space for the next stage
- stage 3: watch the algorithm do the job
- if you want to try again close the window and run the scrip again
# Attention: dont try to leave the window while its searching. Wait for the result and then you can leave
